The osmctools were taken from https://github.com/mjaschen/osmctools

to compile osmconvert you will also need zlib, taken from https://www.zlib.net/
For your convenience a copy of zlib has been placed here, including a CBuilder project in contributions.

osmctools has been modified to allow compiling by CBUILDER. Version used was RAD12.1 Community Edition.

Open CBuilder\osmctools\src\osmctools.groupproj in CBuilder and build all projects.
Executables should be produced in the bin diectory.
